Brain Dump for My Talk
======================
Here's where I try to get all my thoughts out

Olivander - entrepeneur like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. Bill Gates
The Weasley Twins - enterpeneur like Mark Zuckerberg

Who can I call out as like DHH? That's a tricky one but will get a laugh.

---------------------------------
Good afternoon.

My name is Lovelyn Treasurebox [slide: Jaime Lyn Schatz - Je te vois francophiles / Sprechen sie Deutsch? ]

And I am a half blood. My mother is a Muggle but my father was part of the magical world. [ slide: pic of Dad with some online chat room stuff ]

Finally, though, I opened my eyes to the wonderful magical world before me and I dove right in. (Find a tweet about this)

But you'll notice that my robes and spellbooks are not from Diagon Alley [slide: Codecademy, GitHub, StackOverflow]

My wand (pause, touch laptop) was from a friend and her magical network, given to me at a time of greatest despair. My first steps into the wizarding world were a long time in coming.

For years, I didn't listen to the quiet owls rapping on my window pane. You see, only a chosen few are sent the level of owls empowered by Dumbledore (need to fix this)

// ===== > where to use this???    =======>    I've even been lucky enough to find some of my father's magical commentary (NOT the Orange Book)

And I've been very lucky. (move halfblood portion here?)

But how many of our next generation's Hermione Grangers won't be lucky?
With the threats and challenges looming on the horizon (privacy, security, power), we need every single shining star and diamond in the rough, working together to both defend and guide us as we move forward.

Owls are not enough to find .

And if we continue reaching out, we will ffind that all kinds of birds can be messengers. [slide: Ada Academy Tweet? Or many tweets from different orgs -- bootcamps, FreeCodeCamp, etc]

But Hogwarts faces an additional challenge. Once our students are in Hogwarts, a few of our brightest are not finding what they need there. [slide: The Bill and Zuclkerberg picture here] Thw Weasley Twins quite notoriously abandoned their educations to follow their creative sides. Their entrepenurial spiritss have brought great joy [slide: XBox + Facebook], even while they've spent a bit of our productivity (and more than a bit of our gold) along the way

And they are not alone. We sometimes forget that even Olivander himself, our revered wandmaker, [slide: Steve Jobs and a Mac], upon whose tools so much of *our* magic depends, did not complete his education at Hogwarts with a stellar record. And there are so many more [slides: Rebecca Garcia .... NEED MORE HERE ]

We need to make room for all of these magical minds to build and create in their own ways, as well -- even if that means extending magical training and wizardly mentorship beyond Hogwarts' walls.

A third and final challenge that is sometimes only whispered: The MInistry of Magic ( need good ref here ) is finding that the spells taught at Hogwarts are insufficient. Even our brightest graduates are found lacking in the latest techniques and charms. Much of this was revealed in the period immediately after the battle of Hogwarts. (need a ref, need a ref, need a ref) By having the opportunity to develop their magical skills in the world, our most favored trio are prepared for any magical venture.

So we are now faced with great threats [slide: the Threats] and a growing body of students who are either too old for Hogwarts or who have needs beyond the Hogwarts curriculum. We need to look beyond Hogwarts.

First, we need to take better advantage of the recent explosion in beginner magical training opportunities. Just a few years ago, a budding witch or wizard's only real opportunity to study magic was within Hogwarts' walls. 
That time has gone. High quality beginner-level magical training is just a swish and flick away [slide: Codecademy screenshot of a problem and solution?, slide: FreeCodeCamp, slide: CodeNewbies] And, yes, there is a great deal of bad magic out there, as well [slide: "How Not to Design a MOOC"]. It is up to us to help best training spread and increase its reach.

Next, there have been tremendous strides in developing Hogwarts-level magical training in smaller venues. [slides: Ada Developers Academy, HackerSchool, Madison Software Academy, Hungry Academy] What these smaller schools lack in scale individually (show capacity for each), they make up for in total reach. We need more of them. A lot more. One of these magical schools regularly received 20 times the number of QUALIFIED applicants than they have capacity for. When asked what they needed to expand, one member replied: 

Finally, we need a revival of an old idea: apprenticeships. [slide: the Sorcerer's Apprentice]
Magica industries both large [slide: Thoughtworks University http://info.thoughtworks.com/ac-naand Enova's apprenticeships program https://www.enova.com/] and small [slide: iTrellis http://www.itrellis.com/] have already embarked on this path. There is still a terrible unbalance between the numbers of witches and wizards seeking out apprenticeships and those enabling them.
