Brain Dump for My Talk
======================
Here's where I try to get all my thoughts out

Olivander - entrepeneur like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. Bill Gates
The Weasley Twins - enterpeneur like Mark Zuckerberg

Who can I call out as like DHH? That's a tricky one but will get a laugh.

Good afternoon.

My name is Lovelyn Treasurebox [slide: Jaime Lyn Schatz - Je te vois francophiles / Sprechen sie Deutsch? ]

And I am a half blood. My mother is a Muggle but my father was part of the magical world. [ slide: pic of Dad with some online chat room stuff ]

Finally, though, I opened my eyes to the wonderful magical world before me and I dove right in. (Find a tweet about this)

But you'll notice that my robes and spellbooks are not from Diagon Alley [slide: Codecademy, GitHub, StackOverflow]

My wand (pause, touch laptop) was from a friend and her magical network, given to me at a time of greatest despair. My first steps into the wizarding world were a long time in coming.

For years, I didn't listen to the quiet owls rapping on my window pane. You see, only a chosen few are sent the level of owls empowered by Dumbledore (need to fix this)

// ===== > where to use this???    =======>    I've even been lucky enough to find some of my father's magical commentary (NOT the Orange Book)

And I've been very lucky. (move halfblood portion here?)

But how many of our next generation's Hermione Grangers won't be lucky?
With the threats and challenges looming on the horizon (privacy, security, power), we need every single shining star and diamond in the rough, working together to both defend and guide us as we move forward.

Owls are not enough.

And if we continue reaching out, we will ffind that all kinds of birds can be messengers. [slide: Ada Academy Tweet? Or many tweets from different orgs -- bootcamps, FreeCodeCamp, etc]

But Hogwarts faces an additional challenge. Once our students are in Hogwarts, a few of our brightest are not finding what they need there. [slide: The Bill and Zuclkerberg picture here] Thw Weasley Twins quite notoriously abandoned their educations to follow their creative sides. Their entrepenurial spiritss have brought great joy [slide: XBox + Facebook], if a llittle less productivity.

And they are not alone. We sometimes forget that even Olivander himself [slide: Steve Jobs and a Mac], upon who's tools so much of *our* magic depends, did not complete his education at Hogwarts with a stellar record. And there are so many more [slides: Rebecca Garcia .... NEED MORE HERE ]

We need to make room for all of these magical minds to build and create in their own ways, as well -- even if that means extending magical training and wizardly mentorship beyond Hogwarts' walls.

A third and final challenge that is sometimes only whispered: The MInistry of Magic ( need good ref here ) is finding that the spells taught at Hogwarts are insufficient. Even our brightest graduates are finding themelves lacking in the latest techniques 

We need to make room for all of these magical
