Beyond Hogwarts
======================
A Half-Blood's Perspective on Inclusive Magical Education

---------------------------------
Good afternoon, Professors, distinguished guests, Head Mistress, scholars and gentlefolk. My name is Lovelyn Treasurebox [slide: Jaime Lyn Schatz - Je te vois francophiles / Sprechen sie Deutsch? ]

It is an absolute honor to be with you here today at RavenConf.

While I'm not an offical Alumna, House Ravenclaw has drawn me in with welcoming arms. It's a remarkable magical community.

But you already knew that.

As you've read in your scrolls, [slide: Yes, you're in the right place. Lovelyn here thinks she's at RavenConf. Just play along.] my talk today is titled "Beyond Hogwarts - A Half-Blood's Perspective on Inclusive Magical Education." [slide: psst.... Hogwarts == CS Degree]

For generations, the magical world was make up of witches and wizards carefully identified before they are even teens, cloistered away in magical schools like Hogwarts or Durnstrang or the Salem Witches Institute. There they are trained and groomed in their magical abilities and then sent out into the world to carry on our traditions.

It's been a good system, proven by time and trial to grow the magical talent we need to thrive.

But several years ago, the magical world faced a threat like no other. It is easy to forget that when Voldemort and his forces threatened us all, two of the three wizards (and witch) who led his defeat were not raised in the magical world. Those events have lifted veil and have revealed to the World the incredible magical potential of Muggleborn (and I believe, even of Squibs.)

As you might have already guessed, I am a half blood. My mother is a Muggle but my father was part of the magical world. [ slide: pic of Dad with some online chat room stuff ] I was raised in the Muggle world, complete with Muggle Schooling [slide: Sarah Lawrence College]. I was quite fortunate and unlike Mr. Harry Potter, was never actively denied my magical heritage [slide: pic of me and the Vulcan shirt from Christmas -?? can't find this picture] But I was never actively brought into the magical world, either. So I thought my magical side was just a fluke. I thought it couldn't possibly be strong enough to warrant pursuing.

So for years, I ignored quiet owls rapping on my window pane. [slide: LaGuardia HS vs. Stuvesant] You see, only a chosen few are summoned to Hogwarts with the tenacity of Headmaster Dumbledore. [slide: the masses of letters sent to Harry]. My first steps into the wizarding world were a long time in coming.

Finally, though, I opened my eyes to the wonderful magical world before me and I dove right in. (Find a tweet about this) I've even been lucky enough to find some of my father's magical commentary (NOT the Orange Book)

But you'll notice that my robes are hand-sewn. And spellbooks are only borrowed from Diagon Alley [slide: GitHub]

And my precious wand (pause, touch laptop) was a gift from a magical friend and her equally magical network, given to me at the time of my greatest despair.

Like Hermione Granger, I've been very lucky.

But how many of our next generation's Hermione won't be as lucky? Where would we be now if other half-bloods or muggle born like Severus Snape [slide: DHH] or Lily Evans [slide: NO IDEA] never made their way through Hogwarts' halls?

There are great and terrible things just past the horizon. We will need every bit of magical talent we can find to face them and we must all look beyond Hogwarts and our old ways of growing magical talent. And if we continue reaching out, we will find that all kinds of birds can be messengers. [slide: CodeNewbie tweet]

And it's not just Muggle-born who have needs Beyond Hogwarts. Once our students are in school, a few of our brightest are not finding what they need there. [slide: The Bill and Zuckerberg picture here] The Weasley Twins quite notoriously abandoned their educations to follow their creative sides. When you literally set a fire dragon charm on your teacher and then fly out of school on a broomstick, fireworks spraying, itâ€™s hard NOT to be remembered for dropping out. Their entrepenurial spirits have brought the magical world great joy [slide: XBox + Facebook], even as they've taken a bit of our productivity (and a LOT of our gold) in return.

And they are not alone. We sometimes forget that even Olivander himself, our revered wandmaker, [slide: Steve Jobs and a Mac], upon whose tools so much of *our* magic depends, is not known for an illustrious school career at Hogwarts. And there are so many more [slides: Rebecca Garcia, Jen Meyers  .... NEED MORE HERE ]

We need to make room for all of these magical minds to build and create in their own ways, as well -- even if that means extending Hogwarts-level magical training and wizardly mentorship beyond Hogwarts' walls.

A third and final challenge that is sometimes only whispered: The Ministry of Magic [slide: Microsoft] is finding that the spells taught at Hogwarts are (sometimes) insufficient. Even our brightest graduates are found lacking in the latest techniques and charms. While their theoretical knowledge is superb, learning the magical theory does not help much when faced with a real-life conflict. [slide: MERGE CONFLICT, that is]

OWLS are not enough.

This gap between knowledge and experience, between theory and practice was revealed after the Battle of Hogwarts.

To be blunt, the students who fought (and survived) Voldemort and his Death Eaters are simply better witches and wizards today. By having the opportunity to develop their magical skills in the real world, our most favored trio and their battling allies are better prepared for any magical venture. Whether that be in times of peace, or times of war.

So we are now faced with great threats [slide: the Threats] and a growing body of students who are either too old for Hogwarts or who have needs beyond the Hogwarts curriculum. We need to look beyond Hogwarts.

First, we need to take better advantage of the recent explosion in beginner magical training opportunities. Just a few years ago, a budding witch or wizard's only real opportunity to study magic was within Hogwarts' walls. 
That time has gone. High quality beginner-level magical training is just a swish and flick away [slide: Codecademy screenshot of a problem and solution?, slide: FreeCodeCamp, slide: CodeNewbies] And, yes, there is a great deal of bad magic out there, as well. It is up to us to amplify the best training and increase its reach.]

Next, there have been tremendous strides in developing Hogwarts-level magical training in smaller venues. [slides: Ada Developers Academy, HackerSchool, Madison Software Academy, Hungry Academy] What these smaller schools lack in scale individually, they make up for in total reach. We need more of them. A lot more. [slide: stats for Ada Academy] One of these magical schools regularly receives many times more the number of QUALIFIED applicants than they have capacity for. When asked what they needed to expand, one witch involved in selecting the next cohort of new witches replied that they'd love to: She said that they have the demand and they have support from magical industries. What they lacked was enough witches and wizrds to teach them all. [slide : (figure out how to embed the tweet here <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/pete_higgins">@pete_higgins</a> I think the bottleneck is in experienced Ruby devs to teach, not students or sponsors. So the question is why don&#39;t YOU, Pete?</p>&mdash; Elizabeth Uselton (@lizuselton) <a href="https://twitter.com/lizuselton/status/485253770796748800">July 5, 2014</a></blockquote>

Finally, we need a revival of an old idea: apprenticeships. [slide: the Sorcerer's Apprentice]
Magical industries both large [slide: Thoughtworks University http://info.thoughtworks.com/ac-naand Enova's apprenticeships program https://www.enova.com/] and small [slide: iTrellis http://www.itrellis.com/] have already embarked on this path. There is still a terrible unbalance between the numbers of witches and wizards seeking out apprenticeships and those enabling them.

We are poised at the brink of a new age in the wizarding world. By increasing the reach of our owls, enabling magical training beyond Hogwarts' walls and by expanding the reach and depth of apprenticeship programs, we will be ready to identify, reach and train the army of witches and wizards we will need to face the magical challenges ahead of us. I invite all of you to join me in this mission to reach out Beyond Hogwarts for the future of our magical world.

With the threats and challenges looming on the horizon (privacy, security, power), we will need every single shining star and diamond in the rough, working together to both defend and guide us as we move forward.

Thank you.

And, yes, we do have some time for questions.

...

Thank you, again. 

And be sure to leave some floo powder behind for those next in line! [slide: send the elevator back down.]
